Testing


When testing i have been working with validator.w3.org for the HTML and for the CSS jogsaw.w3.org validator. 

When testing the first time i got a few errors regarding the icon links. And the links to each site. I first started doint the project in visual studios but later on changed to gitpod and then i hadent made a few changes to connect each website. 
And i also got a warning regardning one section that lacked a h element. And that has been changed so the warning isent showing. 

Testing later i got a few errors about the social links and icons that the end tag of <a> was missing. 
The problem was then fixed and the error did not show again. 
Also one paragraph text missed the end tag and the problem was fixed. 

A lot of missing end tags at each time for testing. All has been fixed. 



When validating the Style css i got no errors.
